I'm Rodrigo. I enjoy learning and aplying tools to solve engineering problems.

This site presents how I use math, physics, coding, CAD and CAE in small but interesting projects.

My goal is to show my progress in my favorite subjects and share what I like to do as a hobby.

# Interests
My main fields of study are:

* **Naval Architecture**: ships, boats, submarines and other marine vehicles; design and construction; hydrostatics; intact and damaged stability; hydrodynamics; structures. 
* **Ocean Engineering**: fixed and floating offshore structures; pipelines and risers; mooring; marine and offshore renewable energy.

On these fields, I'm mostly interested in:

* **Hydrodynamics and Aerodynamics**: computational fluid dynamics; fluid-structure interaction; wave mechanics; ship resistance and propulsion; seakeeping; ship maneuvering; energy saving devices; wave energy converters; wind-assisted propulsion; wind-turbine aerodynamics.

# Tools
* **Programming**: Python; Fortran; MATLAB.
* **CAD**: Rhinoceros; AutoCAD.
* **CAE**: Maxsurf; OrcaFlex; Ansys.
